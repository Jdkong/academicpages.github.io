The aim is to use social, economic, and environmental factors  across the globe to explain through correlations the initial dynamics of COVID-19 across countries before non-pharmacological interventions   were introduced. This is in collaboration with [Aria Ahmad](https://dighr.yorku.ca/people/aria-ilyad-ahmad/), [Edward Tekwa](https://edwardtekwa.weebly.com) and [Sarah Gignoux-Wolfsohn](https://serc.si.edu/research).
