The overarching goal here is to formulate and analyze stoichiometry based models for the dynamics of phytoplankton and 
bacteria in a stratified lake. It  is a join venture with [Simon Levin](https://slevin.princeton.edu) , [Hao wang](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~hwang/) and 
[Junping Shi](https://www.wm.edu/as/cams/mathematical-biology/faculty/shi-j.php)
