The aim is to formulate and analyze models  for predicting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from oil sands tailing ponds (OSTP) and end pit lakes (EPL). It is a collaborative venture with [Hao Wang](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~hwang/), [Julia Foght](http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/faculty/julia_foght/), [Mark Lewis](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~mlewis/) and   [Tarq Siddique](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/tariqs).
