I have done substantial research on indirectly and directly transmitted infectious diseases. I formu- lated and analyzed a cholera transmission model, which explicitly includes the dynamics of bacte- riophage and bacteria, and also contains an indirect infection term which accounts for a minimum infectious dose of the pathogen V. cholerae. At the moment, I am working on a multi-scale model for Guppy-Gyrodactylus interactions. This is a collaborative research venture involving G. Fussmannâ€™s lab (biology at McGill university) and my supervisor. In this first phase of the project we are formulating a guppy-gyrodactylus interaction model with distributed delay. The model consists of five coupled nonlinear differential equations tracing the rates of change of guppy population, guppy immune response and gyrodactylus population. The guppy total population is divided into three sub-groups: susceptible, infected, and recovered guppies. This project at the interface of math- ematics and experimental epidemiology attempts to provide an experimental test bed for spatial disease and host-parasite dynamics. The proposed research project provides a unique opportunity to establish an ethically acceptable and cost-effective explorative tool for general infectious disease dynamics. In the next phase of the project, we will modify it to a mathematical model that contains two nested meta-population levels. At the basal level, guppies serve as patches for parasites, which disperse from fish to fish; the higher level consists of fish groups in different patches that are linked through dispersal of parasitized or non-parasitized guppies
