I am Jude Kong an *NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow.* I earned my PhD in *Applied Mathematics* alongside an embbeded certificate in *Data Science* from the University of Alberta. My area of research is Mathematical Biology, with a focus in spatial ecology and infectious diseases. Mathematical models include  ordinary differential  equations,  partial  differential equations, delay differential equations, difference equations and stochastic process-based models. Ecological and epidemiological problems include forecasting species ranges, modelling the dynamics of phytoplankton and bacteria in marine waters,  predicting  greenhouse gases emissions from tailings ponds and  understanding the spread and persistence of infectious diseases. Analytical techniques include local and global stability analysis, bifurcation analysis, theory of monotone dynamical systems, persistence theory and sensitivity analysis.
