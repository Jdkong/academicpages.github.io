I am Jude Kong an *NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow.* I earned my PhD in *Applied Mathematics* alongside an embbeded certificate in *Data Science* from the University of Alberta.  I formulate  and analyze models in order  to answer key  ecological  and epidemiological questions. Most of the models I formulate are in terms of ODE, PDE, and DDE,  following fundamental chemical and physical laws. Analytical techniques include local and global stability analysis, bifurcation analysis, theory of monotone dynamical systems, persistence theory, sensitivity analysis, etc.  I have also gained expertise in employing diverse tools such as regression analysis, data mining, machine learning and time series analysis. 

My primary research work focuses on formulating and analyzing stoichiometry based biodegradation models. Questions I attempt to answer include:
* What mechanisms allow microbes and  resources  to persist uniformly or go extinct?
* How do the grazers affect decomposition?
* How can the rate of decomposition be maximized or minimized?
* What are the impacts of important factors such as temperature, priming effect, and inhibitory effect of excess  organic matter on the decomposition rate?

Additionally, I develop and analyze  stoichiometry based models for  the dynamics of phytoplankton  in a stratified lake. These models  incorporate the  dependence of phytoplankton production on light and cellular nutrient contents.  The main objectives here are twofold:
* firstly, to examine how the key features of a stratified lake, such as the depths of epilimnion and hypolimnion, nutrient and light availability, affect the persistence, extinction and biodiversity of algae and bacteria in a stratified lake and
* secondly to dicuss how human activities, such as nearby agriculture or industrial pollution, cause harmful algal blooms (HAB) in a stratified lake.

I also have a vested interest in diseases dynamics, which is growing rapidly. The current focus is on  formulating and analyzing directly and indirectly  transmitted infectious disease model among homogenous populations as well as heterogeneous populations.  Questions aim to answer include:
* Why are there irregularities in seasonal patterns of outbreaks amongst different countries?
* How  can we estimate the transmission   function of an infectious disease  from a given incidence or prevalence data set?
* What is the estimated value of the basic reproduction number in affected regions?
