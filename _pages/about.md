The Kong Research Group  is led by *Jude Dzevela Kong*, a Professor in the [Department of Mathematics & Statistics](https://mathstats.info.yorku.ca) at York University and a member of the [Canadian Center for Disease Modelling](http://www.cdm.yorku.ca).

We work on Mathematical problems in infectious diseases and population dynamics. Mathematical models include ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, delay differential equations, difference equations and stochastic process-based models.

Epidemiological and ecological  problems include: 
i) studying and forecasting the transmission and spread of pathogens within and among human populations 
ii) designing frameworks for assessing pandemic potentials of different regions

iii) understanding, forecasting (near-term), or projecting (long-term) species distribution under potential future ecosystem conditions

iv) studying the impacts of oil sands on our environment

Analytical techniques include local and global stability analysis, bifurcation analysis, theory of monotone dynamical systems, persistence theory and sensitivity analysis.
